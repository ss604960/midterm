    <strong><u>What did you find challenging about this project?</u></strong><br>
     -> I found trying to use the grid system to be rather challenging. I had trouble handling the div containers, rows, and columns
and other various units to get the layout to move and change correctly when you resize the window.<br>
<strong><u>What did you find interesting about this project?</u></strong><br>
     -> Something I found interesting was the content needed for page 1. I'm glad it was necessary to incorporate so many images
    because it gave me an opportunity to use some of the images of my own photography. I currently have a wix website that I use
    as a portfolio for my photography and other art, but eventually I'd like to have an online portfolio website that I've made 
    completely on my own. And while doing this project I got a better idea of the most efficient ways to organize and set up 
    multiple images in css.<br> 
<strong><u>Were there any techniques you learned by doing this project?</u></strong><br>
    -> I now understand and know how to use the grid system more efficiently and am more confident that I will be able to utilize it more easily later on. I think it's an overall important aspect of css to understand because it ultimately makes the process of getting a window to flex and adjust much easier. <br>
<strong><u>Did you use any resources to help you with this project?</u></strong><br>
     -> I used www.w3schools.com occassionally to help me fix small issues I had with css or whenever I found certain things
    weren't working the way I wanted them to. <br>
<strong><u>Did you try anything out and have to delete it because it just wasn't working?</u></strong><br>
    -> I had to try several grid system techniques in css before I found one that worked. I found myself deleting then reentering
    multiple codes until I found a system that worked for me.<br>
<strong><u>How would you improve a portion of this project (you must answer this question).</u></strong> <br>
    -> Since I did have to start this project from the beginning once I lost all my previous work, this site itself is overall <br>
    not as advanced or visually appealing as I had hoped it would be. I hope in the next project I will be able to make a much <br>
    more advanced site.
